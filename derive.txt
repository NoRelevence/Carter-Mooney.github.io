https://random-ize.com/random-website/

I landed here from google after remembering it existed during some hyjinx back in elementary school

It is honestly a fairly modest but dated website, there are some ads for their social media and some random quotes, 
but mainly just a button in the middle that says "next Website"

There are 4 drop down menus at the top of the page and a search bar that bring you to different sites from different people 
or from the same creator, at the bottom, there are four dropdowns that are more or less the leagal side of the site, so 
privacy policy, contact, and the terms of condition are all visible as soon as you land on the site. 

There are mainly 3 places that are interactive on the site, the dropdown menus, on the top and the bottom, and the next website button. 

This site to me is very nostalgic and slightly sketchy, with some of the colors and fonts almost reminicent of a website that is definately gonna give me a virus...
but in the end it is all for good fun and it is all the better for its crude design.  

I would personally try and make it look slightly less sketchy... maybe make it look slightly more streamlined, and maybe a little less outdated. 
so essentially i would just give it a facelift.

http://www.bradthegame.com/

This was the first site that random-ize brought me to.

It is almost entirely green, save for the small white logo that says "Brad: the game" and then two buttons under that say, play and info, 
and under that a quote that states "'Hey, underpants are a type of pants.' -Brad" 
all center aligned on the far right there is some copyright info and the game version. 

There is almost nothing that a normal navigation system would have except for the button that says start and the other that says info, 
the play button will open its own window when clicked and will prompt a text based choose your own adventure style game where you follow 
Brad on various adventures. The info button will move you to a different page one the same window where it shows you 5 options meet the characters, 
BtG Tips and Factoids, Brad the game button thingies, awards, and about the author. It is very simple to navigate since there are so few buttons to speak of. 

Since it is a choose your own adventure game, the entire site is built to be interactive, the only things you can click on will prompt further discovery and have 
intent by the designer to make the entire site seem more that of an experience than just a mere website.

I personally love this site, its very simple and to the point, it was a fun twenty minutes of my life spent figureing out where Brad's life was going and what kind of 
interesting adventure he might get up to with my malevolent guidence as his steering wheel. In turn, i found it to be very interesting... not very useful unless you want a 
few laughs 

The one thing i would change about the site is make the logo bigger.

Furthering through my little trip into the rabbit hole I made it to the personal website of the author of Brad: the game. I made it here from the info section of the games' 
landing page.

This website is built obviously to be a knock off wikipedia page built by the author as a joke towards wikipedia articles. It has everything from an early life section to the 
external links at the bottom where they site their sources. It is actually rather timeless since this site will forever be ingrained into my head as an exact replica of what 
wikipedia has been doing for years. as long as i can remember I have known wikipedia and so finding this site which is just a knockoff is actually rather humerous. 

There is no real navigation system exept for the hundreds of hyperlinks that bring you to different websites. otherwise it is just what a wikipedia site would look like 
if wikipedia had no header bar or search bar. 

I wouldnt say this site is exactly interactive save for scrolling and reading. you can click on images that take you other places and the hyperlinks riddled throughout the site, 
but otherwise... not much interactivity here. 

This website is mainly just very informational, its very bland in that way that looking through wikipedia articles kinda feels, like theres a lot of information there 
when you are only really there to get a source for a paper you already wrote.  

To be totally honest. I wouldnt't change a damn thing. It is perfect for what it is doing. it is creating an illusion that it is a wikipedia page perfectly... 
no need to change anything. I guess maybe add a scuffed wikipedia logo just for some added effect.

From clicking on a random hyperlink from the last one i arrived on youtube. 

Its youtube. Everyone and their mother knows what this is. its one of the most visited web pages of all time. there are thumbnails for other videos underneath the 
video you are currently watching. there are titles and descriptions. 

dashboard, upload button, profile settings, notifications, home button, search bar, thumbnails for other videos.
