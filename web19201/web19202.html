(hinting that there might be more later.) Just a simple drawing to start off with, not much craziness here. </div>

Strands, what do strands look like? little clusters of lines so train up your line accuracy a little bit for this to be able to "consistently" curve your lines right.</div>
        <div data-layer="217d5a0f-1c6c-4273-81cf-4885d1c31352" class="nextBecauseItFitsWithTheClientsLikesWereGonnaMakeHerLookALittleMoreSinisterAndALittleLessSereneToDoThatAllYouHaveToDoIsDarkenUpTheFaceJustALittleBitGiveHerEyesSomeBagsMakeHerLookTiredAddSomeShadows">Next, because it fits with the clients likes, we're gonna make her look a little more sinister and a little less serene. To do that, all you have to do is darken up the face just a little bit, give her eyes some bags, make her look tired, add some shadows even if they kinda shouldn't be there, make the shadows look grungy, use hatching or cross hatching to make this effect come to life.</div>
        <div data-layer="9105a964-189d-4e11-8872-488078bc6e3b" class="thisIsTheFirstBigTimeSkipInTheDrawingBecauseICanExplainEverythingThatHappenedHereALittleEasierIfItsAllDoneAtOnceSoIfYouCantTellSheHasWingsNowAndNoTheyDontReallyMakeSenseButTheyLookLikeTheyMakeSenseA">This is the first BIG time skip in the drawing because I can explain everything that happened here a little easier if its all done at once. So, if you cant tell... she has wings now and no they don't really make sense, but they look like they make sense, and that's all that matters. this will be my first big time sink into this project because shading the same thing over and over again to make them look consistent is... well... tedious. It is all worth it in the end... I'm pretty sure.</div>

        <div data-layer="099ef7d0-d7f0-4ea7-9239-66ce0f5c8022" class="firstThingsFirstBoyosItsTimeToMakeEverythingADarkAssGreyitllMakeSenseLaterSinceThisIsTheBaseColourForTheWingsWeAreJustGonnaUseItToFillInTheEntirePieceConsideringTheyAreTheMostDetailedPartWeDontReallyW">First things first boyos, its time to make everything a dark-ass grey.(it'll make sense later.) Since this is the base colour for the wings we are just gonna use it to fill in the entire piece, considering they are the most detailed part, we don't really want to have to colour them in individually; CAUSE THATS ANNOYING AND TAKES A LONG TIME. *cough* sorry...</div>
        <div data-layer="e6e5c94d-21fe-4f8a-922a-24ba9e41dc97" class="okaySoNowWevePickedASkinToneAndAPinkIshWhiteForHereChokerCallerThingyAndAlsoForYouEagleEyesPeepsOutThereYouMightHaveNoticedThatSomePartsOfHerHairAreDarkerAswellThatsToMakeHerHairHaveALittleBitMoreDept">Okay, so now, we've picked a skin tone and a pink-ish white for here choker-caller thingy, and also for you eagle eyes peeps out there you might have noticed that some parts of her hair are darker aswell, that's to make her hair have a little bit more depth and tone, feeding into the sinister vibe. Oh also, we've added some lighter grey to the wings to make them pop. and to be honest... her colours are done. ONTO THE NEXT THINGY.  </div>
        <div data-layer="0365ae70-098c-4419-94bd-47e047ddb223" class="soIfYouAreHappyWithWhatYouHaveSoFarThenGreatWhateverManJustCallTheDrawingDoneAndGetOverItButIfYouWantToTakeYourDrawingsToTheNextLevelYoullWantToAddSomeBackgroundsAndStuffs">So, if you are happy with what you have so far then great whatever man, just call the drawing done and get over it. BUT! If you want to take your drawings to the next level you'll want to add some backgrounds and stuffs. </div>
        <div data-layer="e4cbd266-c693-4e08-8c2e-089fe6fc1cd5" class="soFirstInThisInstanceIWantToMakeThisDrawingSeemLikeItsInADarkForestOrSomethingButLikeIStatedEarlierThatsHardAndTakesALongTimeSoWereGonnaTakeSomeShortcutsToMakeItSeeeeemLikeWereInADarkForestAndWereO">So first, in this instance, I want to make this drawing seem like its in a dark forest or something. but like I stated earlier, THATS HARD AND TAKES A LONG TIME. So we're gonna take some shortcuts to make it SEEEEEM like we're in a dark forest, and we're only gonna have to draw/ hint at two trees yaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy. To start that process I've added in a dark blue-ish purple colour to the background to make it DARK. again for those eagle-eyed of you, might have already noticed one of our two trees is there over her right shoulder.  </div>
        <div data-layer="2210ca9a-de0d-4b59-826c-389cf4e0e3f2" class="nowAllWeveDoneHereIsDawnInALittleForegroundTreeToCoverUpHalfOfTheScreenDThatWayItSeemsLikeYoureLookingAtHerThroughSomeThickThicketsThisAlsoGiveTheCompostitionSomeNeededFramingAsThisMakesYourEyeLookRigh">Now, all we've done here is dawn in a little foreground tree to cover up half of the screen :D that way it seems like you're looking at her through some thick... thickets this also give the compostition some needed framing, as this makes your eye look right into her... cold evil eyes. I've also added a Vingette to darken up the background a little more and to give some natural shading that will come into use later. </div>
        <div data-layer="ea8396ae-54c3-467b-968d-38e0de6576c7" class="theresNotMuchLeftNowAllIveDoneHereIsAddALittleBallOfLightForPersonalReasonsOrToMakeItMoreDynamicOrSomethingLikeThatIveAlsoAddedInSomeLayerMasksToAssistInChangingJustTheLayerIWantToMakeLighterT">There's not much left now! All I've done here is add a little ball of light, for... personal reasons... or to make it more dynamic... or something like that. I've also added in some layer masks to assist in changing just the layer I want to make lighter. This is also why I added the Vingette; Ooo "I love it when a plan comes together" I've always wanted to use that quote somewhere. (I also added some weird shaded nonsense, that could be like, grass or magic, or bugs or whatever... they just look cool okay.)</div>
        <div data-layer="7bf56441-5b39-4c39-8738-11875a4c0936" class="andBamIAddedALittleBitMoreShadingToDarkenHerUpALittleBitMoreAndToMakeTheBallOfLightMakeMoreSenseAlongWithAlsoAddingALenseFlairWhichIsJustaPhotoshopEffectThatYouCanRenderInAndThisIsTheFinalPieceIHonestly">And BAM I added a little bit more shading to darken her up a little bit more and to make the ball of light make more sense along with also adding a lense flair which is justa  photoshop effect that you can render in. And this is the final piece. I honestly really liked making this one, I hope you think that it's good too, but if you don't that's okay too Ian.</div>
